            <p>Enjoy the world's largest wave organ, creating enchanting harmonies and dissonances by harnessing the natural ebb and flow of the Adriatic Sea.</p>
          <h1 id="city">2. Banja Luka, Republic of Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina</h1>
          <h3>Food:</h3>
            <p>I recommend traveling to Banja Luka by bus or car to fully take in the rustic charm of the idyllic mountainous countryside. Don't be surprised if you find yourself stopped in front of a flock of sheep being herded across the highway. Make sure to try Sarma while you're in town. 
          <h3>Sights:</h3>
            <p>Check out the historical sites Banja Luka has to offer, dating back several ages past.</p>
          <h1 id="city">3. Belgrade, Serbia</h1>
          <h3>Food:</h3>
            <p>After flying into Serbia's Nikola Tesla airport, which you won't be surprised to find out is neatly decorated with apt technology-related decor, you can enjoy Serbian beer before you even leave the airport!</p>
            <p>For the sweets-lover, make sure to try Chesnitsa (like a decadent Baklava), but remember, it's availability depends on the season (winter holidays are the best)!</p>
